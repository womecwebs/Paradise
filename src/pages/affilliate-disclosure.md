  <h2>Transparency Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Paradise is a travel discovery and planning platform. To support the
    operation, development, and maintenance of this website, we may participate
    in affiliate marketing programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that some links on our website are<strong>
      affiliate links</strong
    >. If you click on these links and make a purchase or booking, Paradise may
    earn a commission — <strong>at no additional cost to you.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3 class="color-blue mt-70">What This Means for You</h3>
  <p><strong>Affiliate links help us:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Invest in high-quality travel guides and destination content</li>
    <li>Continue expanding destination and experience coverage</li>
    <li>Maintain and improve website features and performance</li>
    <li>Keep the platform free to use especially travel tools</li>
  </ul>

      >The presence of affiliate links does not affect the price you pay or the
      way you use any booking platform. Infact some have Discounts</strong
